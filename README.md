Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) Solver

The code snippet addresses the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP), a classic optimization problem in computer science and mathematics. The problem involves a salesman who must visit a set of cities exactly once and return to the starting city, aiming to minimize the total distance traveled. Here's a breakdown of the code's functionality:

1. Generating Random Cities
The code begins by generating a set of random cities using the RandomCitiesList class. Each city is represented by its coordinates on a 2D plane.

2. Plotting Cities
After generating the random cities, the code plots them on a graph for visualization. This step helps to visualize the spatial distribution of the cities.

3. Brute-Force TSP Solver
The main focus of the code is to solve the TSP using a brute-force approach. Brute-force involves exhaustively checking all possible permutations of the cities to find the shortest route. While effective for small numbers of cities, this approach becomes impractical for larger sets due to its exponential time complexity.

4. Recording Time
To measure the efficiency of the brute-force algorithm, the code records the time taken to solve the TSP.

5. Visualizing the Shortest Route
Once the shortest route is found, the code plots the path on the graph, highlighting the optimal sequence in which the cities should be visited.

Conceptual Summary
Overall, the code demonstrates a basic implementation of solving the TSP using brute-force methodology. While suitable for small datasets, brute-force becomes inefficient for larger instances due to its computational complexity. This code provides a starting point for understanding TSP algorithms and serves as a foundation for exploring more efficient optimization techniques, such as heuristic algorithms (e.g., genetic algorithms, simulated annealing) or dynamic programming approaches.

The computational time required for solving the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) increases dramatically as the number of cities grows, as demonstrated by the following data:

- **5 cities:** 0.000131 seconds
- **6 cities:** 0.000669 seconds
- **7 cities:** 0.004114 seconds
- **8 cities:** 0.031297 seconds
- **9 cities:** 0.275178 seconds
- **10 cities:** 2.696943 seconds
- **11 cities:** 28.516642 seconds

This exponential increase in computation time is characteristic of brute-force algorithms, such as the one used in this example. Brute-force methods involve exhaustively checking all possible permutations of city sequences, making them impractical for large-scale TSP instances. Thus, there's a pressing need for more efficient algorithms, particularly when dealing with real-world TSP problems that may involve a significant number of cities.
